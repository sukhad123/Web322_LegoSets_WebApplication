# Web322 Final Project: Lego Data Web Application

Welcome to the Web322 Final Project repository! This project is a dynamic web application designed to store real-time Lego data information. It was developed from scratch following the Waterfall Model approach.

## Features

- **Real-time Lego Data**: The application allows users to store and retrieve detailed information about Legos.
- **Node.js Backend**: Utilizes Node.js for server-side development.
- **Frontend Technologies**: HTML5, CSS, Embedded JS Templates, and JavaScript were used for the frontend, with Tailwind CSS framework for styling.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL is used for storing Lego details, while MongoDB is utilized for user data (login credentials) and cookies.

## Project Structure

- **`server.js`**: Entry point for the Node.js server.
- **`public/`**: Contains static assets such as CSS files and client-side JavaScript.
- **`views/`**: Embedded JS templates for dynamic HTML rendering.
- **`routes/`**: Backend route handlers.
- **`models/`**: Database models and schemas.

## Usage
